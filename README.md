## Description

_Consider the source code here a digital sandbox of sorts where I freely tinker with a basic UI and store mini coding exercises perhaps for later reference_

_To date, this code features a roman numeral converter, a triangle tracker, a palindrome tool, a prime number finder, a card deck generator, a temperature converter_
